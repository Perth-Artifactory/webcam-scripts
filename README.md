# webcam-scripts

The collection of scripts used to manage our webcam feeds. Authentication keys are largely not centrally managed and have been removed from the code.

* `images/` Contains scripts and resources for pulling images from cameras.
* `presence/` Contains scripts for pulling clients from the WiFi.
* `updateCameras/` Contains scripts for bulk editing camera settings. An example update.sh has been provided that can be used to upload custom watermarks.
* `HealthChecks.io/` Contains a script for adding and updating checks in HealthChecks.io
